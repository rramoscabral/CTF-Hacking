# CTF Hacking
Capture The Flag (CTF)


CTFs are information security competitions in conferences or events.



## Types of Challenges

There are several different challenges:
 - **Cryptography** Can be "real world" scenarios about encryption (base64, roman cypher, RSA, etc) ransomware and others.
 - **Exploitation** Basicly using exploit like SQL injection, buffer overflow, string format, etc.
 - **Penetration Testing Labs/Pwn** - Exploiting a servers.
 - **Programming** Require some sort of programming like PHP, C#, Java, ect.
 - **Reverse Engineering/Binary** - Reverse engineering or exploiting a binary file.
 - **Steganography** Finding information hidden in files or image.
 - **Web** Exploiting web pages
